      "<p><b>Roger Federer</b> (<small>German pronunciation:</small> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər]</span>; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 2 in men's singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Federer has won 19 Grand Slam singles titles, the most in history for a male tennis player and has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 302 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks. After turning professional in 1998, he was continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016. He re-entered the top ten by his victory at the 2017 Australian Open.</p>\n",
      "<p>In majors, he has won a record eight Wimbledon titles, five Australian Open titles, a record five consecutive US Open titles and one French Open title. He is among eight men to have captured a career Grand Slam and has reached a record 29 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including ten in a row from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open. Given these achievements, many players and analysts consider Federer the greatest tennis player of all time.</p>\n",
      "<p>Among Federer's other ATP tournament records include winning six ATP World Tour Finals, 27 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments, and 19 ATP World Tour 500 tournaments. He has also won an Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stan Wawrinka at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and an Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Representing Switzerland, Federer was a part of the 2001 winning Hopman Cup team and the 2014 winning Davis Cup team.</p>\n",
      "<p>Federer has been named Swiss Sports Personality of the Year a record seven times. In 2007, he won the ESPY Award for Best International Athlete and he has won the Best Male Tennis Player award a record seven times. He was named ATP Player of the Year five times, was named ITF World Champion five times, and won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year for a record four consecutive years. He was named four times the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year. In 2017, ESPN ranked him fourth in its most famous athletes list, first among tennis players.</p>\n",
      "<p><b>Tennis</b> is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>\n",
      "<p>Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as <b>lawn tennis</b>. It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term <i>tennis</i> referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel <i>Sybil</i> (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will \"go down to Hampton Court and play tennis.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.</p>\n",
      "<p>Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.</p>\n",

The set $\\\\cha(X)$ of one-dimensional\\ncomplex valued characters of the fundamental group of $X$ forms an algebraic\\ngroup. Consider the subset of $\\\\cha(X)$ consisting of those characters for\\nwhich the corresponding local system has nontrivial cohomology in a given\\ndegree $d$. This set is shown to be a union of finitely many components that\\nare translates of algebraic subgroups of $\\\\cha(X)$. When the degree $d$ equals\\n1, it is shown that some of these components are pullbacks of the character\\nvarieties of curves under holomorphic maps. As a corollary, it is shown that\\nthe number of equivalence classes (under a natural equivalence relation) of\\nholomorphic maps, with connected fibers, of $X$ onto smooth curves of a fixed\\ngenus $>1$ is a topological invariant of $X$. In fact it depends only on the\\nfundamental group of $X$.', 'author': {'name': 'Donu Arapura'}, 'arxiv:comment': {'@xmlns:arxiv': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', '#text': '5 pages'}, 'arxiv:journal_ref': {'@xmlns:arxiv': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', '#text': 'Bull.

Using these cocycles we develop a\\n``cohomology theory\" for complex algebraic varieties. The theory is bigraded,\\nfunctorial, and admits Gysin maps. It carries a natural cup product and a\\npairing to $L$-homology. Chern classes of algebraic bundles are defined in the\\ntheory. There is a natural transformation to (singular) integral cohomology\\ntheory that preserves cup products. Computations in special cases are carried\\nout. On a smooth variety it is proved that there are algebraic cocycles in each\\nalgebraic rational $(p,p)$-cohomology class.', 'author': [{'name': 'Eric M. Friedlander'}, {'name': 'H.
